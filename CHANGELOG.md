# Changelog

Testers: the app shows an "Update now" banner when a new version is published.

## 0.2.0 — beta hardening

- First-run onboarding (search → collect → trade), with an iOS "Add to Home Screen" hint.
- Error boundary with a copyable diagnostic log (also on the About screen) so bugs are recoverable and reportable.
- Update beacon: the app notices a new published version on launch / when brought to the foreground, not only when the service worker happens to check.
- Nightly card-database refresh so prices stay current.
- Fan Content Policy compliance pass (attribution + checklist).

## 0.1.0 — core beta

- Card database (Scryfall, ~37k cards) downloaded on first launch, then fully offline.
- Search with images, prices, and filters.
- Collection / wishlist / tradelist with editing; import from Moxfield / Archidekt / plain-text; lossless CSV export.
- Decks with owned checkmarks and a "add missing cards to wishlist" prompt.
- In-person trading: 6-character join code, dual offers, accept + confirm, trade history. (Goes live once the trade server has a TLS domain.)
